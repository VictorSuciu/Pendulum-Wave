> The user can draw lines between every pendulum, every other pendulum, every 3rd, 4th, or more to
reveal hidden patterns created by the wave

## User Adjustments

* Number of pendulums between each line
* Angle to which the pendulums swing
* Number of pendulums
* Gravitational acceleration
* Time period before the wave repeats
* Length of the longest pendulum arm
